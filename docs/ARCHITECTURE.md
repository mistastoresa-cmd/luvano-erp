# Luvano-ERP — Ledger Service Architecture

Approved design doc:
`~/.gstack/projects/Luvano-ERP/abdullahbaaqil-unknown-design-20260719-164841.md`

This is Phase 1 of the "Ledger-first / Strangler Fig" approach (Approach C in the
design doc). It is a **new, standalone** service — `luvano-dashboard` (the
existing production analytics app) is not modified. The dashboard will eventually
become a read-client of this ledger, feature by feature, but that migration is
out of scope for this phase.

## What exists in this phase

- Multi-tenant Postgres schema (Neon), tenant-isolated via a `tenant_id` column on
  every table, filtered at the application/query layer (not Postgres RLS).
- Two bounded ledger entities: `inventory_movements` (append-only) and
  `sale_invoices` + `sale_invoice_lines` ("unified invoicing" — one invoice per
  sale event regardless of source).
- A platform-agnostic connector interface (`lib/connectors/types.ts`) plus a
  concrete Salla implementation (`lib/connectors/salla/adapter.ts`) that
  normalizes webhook payloads into ledger events — pure functions over fixture
  payloads, not wired to a live route.
- A `LedgerService` (`lib/ledger/service.ts`) that writes movements/invoices
  atomically and resolves concurrent-write conflicts per
  `docs/design-spikes/01-conflict-resolution.md`.
- The server-side contract for a future branch-sync API
  (`lib/sync/types.ts`), reconciled per
  `docs/design-spikes/02-offline-reconciliation.md`.

## What is explicitly deferred (not built in this phase)

- **No live Salla webhook route.** `app/api/health/route.ts` is the only live
  endpoint. The Salla connector is exercised by unit tests against fixture
  payloads only.
- **No PWA / offline client.** The offline-first requirement from the design doc
  is addressed at the contract level (`lib/sync/types.ts`,
  `docs/design-spikes/02-offline-reconciliation.md`) — no browser code, service
  worker, or local storage queue exists yet.
- **No UI of any kind.**
- **No Zid/Shopify connector implementation** — the interface supports adding one
  later without touching the ledger core, but zero demand evidence exists for
  either platform (see the design doc), so none is built now.
- **No double-entry general ledger / chart of accounts.** The ledger in this
  phase is bounded to inventory movements and sale invoices only — full
  accounting (HR, marketing, coupons, Zakat/tax compliance) is future scope
  per the design doc's phased module list.
- **No OAuth implementation.** `luvano-dashboard/lib/salla-client.ts` and
  `lib/auth.ts` already implement Salla OAuth (token exchange + refresh) and
  work correctly — this will be reused/ported when the live webhook route is
  built, not rebuilt from scratch.
- **No RBAC / user auth system.** `lib/tenancy/context.ts` defines the contract
  a future request handler will use to resolve which tenant a request belongs
  to; no session/auth system backs it yet.

## Why schema-only, not live integration

The design doc's "Demand Evidence" section flags that external, paying-customer
validation has not happened yet — the only evidence so far is the founder's own
prior-employer experience. "The Assignment" in the design doc calls for 3 real
customer conversations before further build investment. This phase deliberately
produces schema + contracts + design decisions (reviewable, low-cost-to-change)
rather than a live integration (expensive to change once real data flows through
it), so validation and architecture work can proceed in parallel without
compounding the risk of building the wrong thing quickly.
